This is a back-end project.
An API which checks for plagiarism or similarity between texts and paragraphs. 
Made from Python, Flask Restful, Docker Compose, Mongo DB, and tested through Postman API. 
This api uses get and post methods where user can also sign in to the api.
There is a token system that when used up can be refilled easily using "/refill" and much more with the tokens.
The more closer to 1 the more similar is the result. 
It uses a trained NLL i.e Natural Language processing model in machine learning.
